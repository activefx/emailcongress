# Email Congress

Lightweight Django project to courier email messages to [phantom-of-the-capitol](https://github.com/EFForg/phantom-of-the-capitol) using Postmark.

This is a work-in-progress to transform [The Phantom Mask](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/the-phantom-mask) to a more 
sustainable Django project with an API, provisioning, and more robust error handling. Oh yeah, also Python 3!
