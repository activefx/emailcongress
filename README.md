# Email Congress

Lightweight web app to courier email messages to phantom-of-the-capitol using postmark.

This is a work-in-progress to transform [The Phantom Mask](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/the-phantom-mask) to a more 
sustainable Django project with an API, provisioning, and more robust error handling. Oh yeah, also Python 3.
